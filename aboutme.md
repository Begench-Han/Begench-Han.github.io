I'm currently an undergraduate at KAIST, where I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering. Additionally, I'm gaining hands-on research experience as an intern at the Institute for Basic Science. My research focuses on the intersection of AI and biological systems, specifically proteins and antibodies. Specifically, the development of an AI-based framework for antigen-conditioned antibody design. 

At the Institute for Basic Science, my contributions include working on antibody sequence design using graph neural networks. I've introduced new models specifically tailored for antibody sequence design and have developed loss functions that consider the unique attributes of antibodies.

While this remains my central focus, I'm also expanding my knowledge in other Machine Learning domains, such as computer vision, neural rendering, diffusion models, and point clouds. Parallelly, I'm investing time in understanding the practical aspects of AI, diving deeper into technologies like CUDA, and exploring hardware accelerators, notably FPGA. Alongside my AI studies, I've improved my software skills by working on a Web3 rewards app and a Figma app for new parents, focusing on user-friendly design (UI/UX). This work has taught me more about building websites and creating good designs that people find easy and helpful to use.

### PROJECTS
- **Neural Radiance Fields:** I worked on a project using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), with a specific focus on optimizing the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), ray sampling, and volume rendering components. This project helped me learn a lot about the processes of 3D scene reconstruction and rendering.
  
- **PointNet Model:** I successfully re-implemented the PointNet model, a neural network for processing point clouds and 3D shapes. This project involved a detailed study of the original paper, allowing me to grasp complex concepts of geometric data processing. The obtained model demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency in handling complex 3D data.
  
- **CUDA Implementation of Convolutional Layers:** I worked on a project where I used the CUDA programming language to implement different layers of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), including Convolution, Batch Normalization, Activation, and Pooling. This experience helped me get hands-on knowledge about how to use CUDA for efficient computing.
  
- **Web3 Eco-Friendly App:** Developed a Web3 application that enables users to submit proof of their eco-friendly activities to earn rewards, which can be redeemed for green products offered at discounted prices.
  
- **New Parent-Friendly Web App:** Worked on designing a simple and accessible web app for new parents using Figma. It offers easy navigation and essential parenting tips. The app's goal is to support parents with straightforward, practical resources.
