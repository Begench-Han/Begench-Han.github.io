I am a Master’s student in the Robotics Program at KAIST, working in the Computer Vision and Learning Lab (KCVL) under Prof. Tae-Kyun Kim. My research focuses on applying deep learning and graph neural networks to biological systems, specifically in protein engineering and antibody design. Recently, I’ve been developing techniques to enhance the wet-lab expressibility of targeted protein classes and creating GNN-based models for evaluating antibody candidates. Outside my primary research, I contribute to interdisciplinary projects, such as computational nuclear history research,
combining data analysis and AI methodologies

Previously, I contributed to projects at the Institute for Basic Science, proposing new antibody-specific models and loss functions for protein sequence design. I’ve also worked on data-driven boiling point prediction of chemical compounds using their structures, and robot gripper design using deep learning.

In addition to my research, I’ve explored cutting-edge topics in machine learning, including neural rendering, point cloud processing, and CUDA-based implementations for efficient computation. I enjoy working on interdisciplinary projects, such as Web3 eco-friendly apps and user-friendly tools, combining technical expertise with impactful applications.

### PROJECTS
- **Neural Radiance Fields:** I worked on a project using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), with a specific focus on optimizing the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), ray sampling, and volume rendering components. This project helped me learn a lot about the processes of 3D scene reconstruction and rendering.
  
- **PointNet Model:** I successfully re-implemented the PointNet model, a neural network for processing point clouds and 3D shapes. This project involved a detailed study of the original paper, allowing me to grasp complex concepts of geometric data processing. The obtained model demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency in handling complex 3D data.
  
- **CUDA Implementation of Convolutional Layers:** I worked on a project where I used the CUDA programming language to implement different layers of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), including Convolution, Batch Normalization, Activation, and Pooling. This experience helped me get hands-on knowledge about how to use CUDA for efficient computing.
  
- **Web3 Eco-Friendly App:** Developed a Web3 application that enables users to submit proof of their eco-friendly activities to earn rewards, which can be redeemed for green products offered at discounted prices.
  
- **New Parent-Friendly Web App:** Worked on designing a simple and accessible web app for new parents using Figma. It offers easy navigation and essential parenting tips. The app's goal is to support parents with straightforward, practical resources.
